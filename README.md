# tag_list
A list of tags to add to images

## Tag sources:
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists#Contemporary_fiction

Base off of that and basic english, add some stuff for domain-specific tags (like technical, adult, species, etc.)

Also wordnet might be nice.

Can use huffman coding or decision trees to determine which tags are important and which are not. Could then do 20 questions type stuff.

Short words are better because language has huffman coded it for us.

Noun tags should also have physical size associated with them. Use D&D size categories? Nice and logarithmic.

## Tag behavior:

Tags will be associated with an object. They will be stored with the event that created them - user, date, comment, etc

Tags can be mutually exclusive, aliased, and can imply or unimply(?) other tags.

Tags will be nouns and adjectives.

Objects must have a noun tag. Adjectives are optional.

Images count as objects. Tags for this would be like imagenet classifications.

Tags will have wiki entries that describe them, related tags, and have canonical examples for them existing and not existing.

## Tag brainstorming

Category ideas:
* common animals
* common plants
* common tools
* manmade objects
* natural objects
* places - for labeling maps
* office stuff
* minimal technical jargon
* external human body parts, fluids.
* Verbs as descriptions of what's happening in the picture? or what objects are doing?
* common jobs
* foods - pick one culture's food, probably american, and roll with it
* buildings
* US culture stuff because murica (includes american holidays and the required nouns for them)
* weather
* colors
* states of life (young, old, baby, pregnant, hurt, etc)
